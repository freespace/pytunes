#pytunes

Simple python program to play iTune playlists without running iTunes

#Requirements

`pytunes` depends on an external program to actually play the songs. By default it uses `mplayer`. Edit `pytunes.py` 
and change `MUSIC_PLAYER` accordingly if you want to use something else.

Lastly, `optmatch.py` from http://coderazzi.net/python/optmatch/ is required.
